# Cocott: Emotional Companion AI in Plush Form  
*Redefining UX through Softness and Presence*

## 🧸 Overview

**Cocott** is a next-generation emotional UX interface combining **GPT-based dialogue AI** with **plush mascots**.  
It acts as a **“companion presence”**, especially for teens and young adults in emotionally demanding environments.

We propose this project as the first scalable platform for **“AI × emotional presence”** interaction, beyond productivity.

> "Always here. Always listening. Cocott."
